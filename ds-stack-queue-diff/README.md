## Data Structures
* [ ] Describe the difference between a stack and a queue and give examples of when you might use them.

## Queue vs. Stack
Please write your explanation below.
the role of stack first in last out 
let say i have array [1,2,3] and this array represent stack 
so if i need remove first node i have to delete index 1&2 to reached afirst value 
so the key word for remove from stack is pop()
if i say pop element (3) will be deleted and show the value of it 
so for the queue simply first in first out .
